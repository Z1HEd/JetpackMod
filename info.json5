  description: "Adds a Jetpack item to the game.\n \
Press F to switch between 3 modes: Flight, Hover and Off, indicated by a switch on the controller.\n \
Flight mode: hold space while mid air to propell upwards. Does nothing otherwise.\n \
Hover mode: will maintain constant height, even by just walking off a block,\n \
Hold SPACE/SHIFT to go up/down. Off mode disables the jetpack.\n \
While flying, Jetpack consumes fuel. Biofuel is cheaper, slower and lasts less than Deadly Fuel.\n \
